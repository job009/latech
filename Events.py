intro = "'Student’ goes into class early to prep for his exam, he sits at his desk inside of his classroom in Nethken Hall. Professor Andrey Timofeyev walks into the classroom like always, except he’s pulling, what looks to be a robot behind him. “Sorry for the noise class” says professor Andrey, 'I’m going to work on a project while you guys take your test'. ‘Student’ decides to use the restroom before the test starts, so he gets up and goes to the restroom. When he returns, he sees a scuffle going on in the classroom. He runs into the class, the robot is going crazy, swinging his sharped edged arms around in a dangerous fit. Until one of them lands directly on professor Andrey’s head. The professor drops to the floor. The class bolts out of the classroom and runs for the doors. They start flooding out of the building ‘Student’ is almost to the front door when the robot leaps in front of him. The exit is blocked, ‘Student’ panics and pulls the fire alarm, as the alarm goes off the robot starts to go into a frenzy. ‘Student’ runs for cover. The robot swings his arms and shatters a glass door to the front office. Sparks are flying out of the robot, it starts to spin like a bottle top with its arms extended, it swings its arms right into a breaker box. The lights go out, it’s pitch black, all ‘Student’ can see is the robots glowing red eyes. ‘Student’ runs for the bathroom and hides."

main = "A killer robot is on the loose inside of the building...‘Student’’s job is to find a way to destroy the robot or a way to escape the building...Good Luck!"
