intro = "You are delivering a pizza to this very nice house. The man opens the door and tells you to wait while he gets the money. After about 5 minutes you hear a crashing sound and screams from another room. You go look and find the man dead in the library. You know the killer is around somewhere because you just heard the front door close and someone locking it. You need to find a way to escape or fight and win. Some items around the house will help you recover or gain energy/ability. Good luck!"
